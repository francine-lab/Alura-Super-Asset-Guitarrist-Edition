# Super Asset Guitarrist Edition Project

The job was to create and super asset game.

## Tasks performed to achieve this project

- The users are able to:
    - Click on the buttons to draw cards, to play or, to go to the next round
    - Choose one attribute to play
    - See their points on the screen
    - See their opponent's card after play

## Extra task

- I implemented a function that uses gifs on cards and display them on the screen 
- Users can listen to a winning song in each round (this function has been disabled because of copyrigths) :D

## To do

- Change the rounds for the machine to also play by choosing an attribute
- Change the dynamics of the game so that the winner of the round wins the card of the loser
